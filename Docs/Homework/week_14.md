âœ… What to Submit
GitHub Repository

Submit the URL to your GitHub repo.

Include a commit reference or tag (e.g., core-complete or feature1-done) that marks the version shown in your demo.

Demonstration of Core Requirements

Your GUI should clearly show that all core project requirements are complete. These typically include:

Real-time weather data displayed

Interactive elements (e.g., city search, forecast view)

Model predictions shown in the UI

Submit either:

A â‰¤ 3-minute screen recording walking through the working app, with narration

Or screenshots showing each key functionality

Feature 1: Fully Implemented

Your first major custom feature (e.g., map integration, alerts, forecast graphs, data comparison, etc.) must be complete and functional.

Highlight this feature in your demo and/or explain it in your text submission.

Brief Description (Text Entry)

Write a short paragraph (3â€“5 sentences) explaining:

What your custom feature is

How it works

Any known bugs or next steps

ðŸ’¡ Tips
Use Loom, OBS, or QuickTime for easy narrated screen recordings.

Make sure the commit/tag you reference matches what you show in your demo.

If your feature has a visual component, make sure to clearly demonstrate it in your screenshots or video.
