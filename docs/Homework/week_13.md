W13 After-Class Assignment 
Due Sunday by 11:59pm 
Points 50 

Submitting a text entry box, a website url, a media recording, or a file upload 

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This assignment combines progress checkpoints from Weeks 12 and 13. You'll submit your GitHub repo, UI design mockups, and a short demo of your API integration. This helps instructors check on your progress, give feedback, and support you in staying on track.

âœ… What to Submit
GitHub Repository

Share the URL to your GitHub repo.

Make sure it includes:

A clear and up-to-date README.md

A basic folder/file structure for your app (even if minimal)

UI Wireframes or Mockups

Upload your design mockups as a PDF, screenshot, or Figma link.

Your mockups should show the key parts of your appâ€™s user interface, especially how forecast data will be displayed.

Updated Timeline (if applicable)

If you've made changes to your project timeline or milestones, include a brief note or upload your updated timeline file.

API Demo & Core Functionality Check-In

Show a working API call in your app that fetches and displays real data in your interface (even if itâ€™s still a rough version).

Submit either:

A â‰¤ 2-minute screen recording showing the API call working, OR

Screenshots of the working app with the API results visible

Write a brief paragraph (3â€“5 sentences) describing:

How you implemented the API call

Any blockers, challenges, or next steps

ðŸ’¡ Tips
Your API doesnâ€™t need to be perfect or finalâ€”just demonstrate that youâ€™ve made a successful call and displayed some part of the data.

Be honest about blockers. This is a chance to get help early!

Use tools like Loom, QuickTime, or OBS for screen recordings if needed.
